# Contributing to Dash Cytoscape

Thank you for your interesting in contributing to this open-source project! Make sure that you have read and understood our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Setting up the environment

Please follow the following steps for local testing:

1. Clone the repo
```commandline
git clone https://github.com/plotly/dash-pivottable.git
```
2. Instal `virtualenv` with `pip install virtualenv`.

3. In order to run the Python builds (`npm run build:py`) you need to create a 
venv for this project. Run this:
```commandline
cd dash-pivottable
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Install the JavaScript dependencies and build the code:
```commandline
npm install
npm run build:all
```

#### Package manager

The preferred package manager for this project is `npm`. If you are using `yarn`, make sure to delete `yarn.lock` and to update `package-lock.json` before merging a PR.

## Coding Style

Please lint any additions to Python code with `pylint` and `flake8`:
```commandline
flake8 --max-line-length=100 usage.py
flake8 --max-line-length=100 tests
pylint usage.py
pylint tests
```

## Code quality & design

-   Is your code clear? If you had to go back to it in a month, would you be happy to? If someone else had to contribute to it, would they be able to?

    A few suggestions:

    -   Make your variable names descriptive and use the same naming conventions throughout the code.

    -   For more complex pieces of logic, consider putting a comment, and maybe an example.

    -   In the comments, focus on describing _why_ the code does what it does, rather than describing _what_ it does. The reader can most likely read the code, but not necessarily understand why it was necessary.

    -   Don't overdo it in the comments. The code should be clear enough to speak for itself. Stale comments that no longer reflect the intent of the code can hurt code comprehension.

*   Don't repeat yourself. Any time you see that the same piece of logic can be applied in multiple places, factor it out into a function, or variable, and reuse that code.
*   Scan your code for expensive operations (large computations, DOM queries, React re-renders). Have you done your possible to limit their impact? If not, it is going to slow your app down.
*   Can you think of cases where your current code will break? How are you handling errors? Should the user see them as notifications? Should your app try to auto-correct them for them?


## Tests

### Running the tests

Activate your virtualenv:
```commandline
source venv/bin/activate
```

If needed, install the requirements:
```commandline
pip install -r tests/requirements.txt
```

Run the following tests:
```commandline
pytest tests
```

### Percy

Make sure to configure your Percy environment variables correctly:
```commandline
PERCY_BRANCH=local
PERCY_ENABLED=1
PERCY_TOKEN=***************
```

You can find the token in the [project settings of the Percy project](https://percy.io/plotly/dash-pivottable/settings). Only members of the Plotly organizations have access to this token.

## Publishing

Create a pull request and tag the Plotly team (`@plotly/dash-core`) and tag / request review from [@xhlulu](https://github.com/xhlulu).

After a review has been done and your changes have been approved, create a prerelease and comment in the PR. Version numbers should follow [semantic versioning][].

To publish or create a prerelease:

1. Check `MANIFEST.in` has all of the extra files (like CSS)
2. Bump version numbers in `package.json`, update the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md), and make a pull request
3. Once the pull request is merged into master:
4. Build
```
npm run build:all
```
5. Create distribution tarball
```
python setup.py sdist
```
6. Copy the tarball into a separate folder and try to install it and run the examples:
```
cp dist/dash_pivottable-x.x.x.tar.gz ../temp
cp usage.py ../temp
cd ../temp
source venv/bin/activate
pip install dash_pivottable-x.x.x.tar.gz
python usage.py
```
7. If the examples work, then publish:
```
npm publish
twine upload dist/dash_pivottable-x.x.x.tar.gz
```
8. Tag your release with git:
```
git tag -a 'vx.x.x' -m 'vx.x.x'
git push origin master --follow-tags
```
9. Verify that the publish worked by installing it:
```
cd ../temp
pip install dash-pivottable==x.x.x
python usage.py
```


Make a post in the [Dash Community Forum](https://community.plotly.com/c/dash)
* Title it `":mega: Announcement! New <Your Feature> - Feedback Welcome"`
* In the description, link to the PR and any relevant issue(s)
* Pin the topic so that it appears at the top of the forum for two weeks

## [Checklists](http://rs.io/unreasonable-effectiveness-of-checklists/)
